# Prompt Accuracy Checker API

The Prompt Accuracy Checker is an application that analyzes the accuracy of prompts for stable diffusion. With the click of a button, users can submit a prompt and receive a percentage score indicating how detailed the prompt is. In addition to the score, users will also see an image related to the prompt and a short description of the prompt.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Prompt Accuracy Checker: 
Clone this repository and run `npm install` && `node server.js`

## Technologies Used
The Back-end of Prompt Accuracy Checker is built using NodeJS. The image generation and scoring is handled by a backend API that the front-end communicates with via GET requests.
